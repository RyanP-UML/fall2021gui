Issues I could not resolve:
- There is a gap between the navbar and the hello world <div> that I have not
 figured out how to remove. This issue can actually be expanded upon, I could 
 not get the padding and margin utilities to apply. I added padding such as 
 'p-1' as a class with no effect.
- I could not figure out how to style the "New" Label. I was able to change the
background color, but was unable to apply padding or border radius to round the
corners.
